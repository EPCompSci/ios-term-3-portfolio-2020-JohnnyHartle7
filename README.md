Hello. My name is Johnny Hartle and I am a junior at Eden Prairie High School. This is a porfolio of all of my projects through the first half of my iOS development class. This was the first time I learned Swift or worked with anu UI in general, so the learning curve was not easy, but I had a great time learning about the platform. 

The apps that I have made in this class so far are not perfect, but I learned something new and improved my coding skills a little more each time I started a new app. Taking this iOS class and learning about Swift development has been a great experience and I am looking forward to learning even more in the future.


## My Apps

###[App With Buttons](https://github.com/JohnnyHartle7/App-With-Buttons)
Description: 
This app is basically just a vert stack with three buttons in it that do not perform any functions. This was the first app I ever created on the Swift platform, which is why it is so simple. 

Learning: 
Regardless of the simplicity of the app, I actually learned a lot during the creation of it. First, I learned about the Swift platform in general and how to add things to the UI. I had never worked on a UI before creating this app, so it was a brand new thing for me. I also learned about stack views and constraints, which are essential to the UI working on multiple different devices. Along with those main learning pieces, I also learned some more simple things about buttons and labels such as adding a background to a button.


###[War Card Game](https://github.com/JohnnyHartle7/WarCardGame)
Description:
The war card game app is an app that allows users to play a common card game, war, against a computer. The user is able to click the “Deal” button, which randomizes 2 card images in front of them. One of the cards is for the user and one is for the CPU, whoever has the higher card value gains a point which is shown on the scoreboard at the bottom of the screen. 

Learning: 
This was the first app that I created where I had to work on the UI side and also on the backend. I learned how to connect aspects of the UI into the backend, creating IB outlets between the code and the UI. In this way, I was able to code the score labels to change after every deal. Along with connecting the UI to the code, I learned how to have a button click to cause something else to happen, change the image on image views, and change labels. I also learned more about constraints and the “Safe Area”.


###[BlackJack](https://github.com/JohnnyHartle7/BlackJack) 
Description: 
Blackjack 2.0 was an app that I worked on for a couple weeks and was the first app I created completely on my own. It is a blackjack app where users start with 100 dollars. Users are able to select the amount they would like to bet and then proceed to play blackjack, which is a popular card game, against the dealer. If they win the hand, the amount they bet will be added to their bankroll while a loss would cause that money to be subtracted from their bankroll. 

Learning: 
The creation of this app was one of my biggest learning experiences of the quarter. First, I learned how to use Sketch to import 3 different sizes of each asset into Swift. I also learned how to create different looking buttons and cards on the Sketch platform. I continued my learning of constraints and their importance. The way I set up the constraints at the start was not ideal and caused the app to only be playable on iPhone 8’s and larger devices, but this was a learning experience for me. The reason the constraints were tough was because there were so many buttons, labels, image views, and stack views incorporated in the app. I incorporated multiple if, then statements in the code for this app. One of the toughest parts for me was the mathematics surrounding the Aces because in Blackjack an Ace can represent a 1 or an 11. I used booleans to work around this and it still isn't perfect, but it is functional. I also used booleans to make sure that users are not able to change their bets or back out of a game while they are in it. Lastly, I learned how to add multiple pages into an app and connect Viewcontrollers to their corresponding page.


###[Login Screen](https://github.com/JohnnyHartle7/LoginScreen) 
Description: 
This app is an example of a good login screen. When a user enters the app, there are animations that take place with the login button and text fields. There is also a nice background and clouds that constantly move around in the background. The login button also slowly changes color. 

Learning: 
This login screen was a little app that I made to learn about animations on Swift. In general, I wasn't that interested in coding games and was looking to learn about more practical applications of coding such as login screens. I learned a lot about how to animate aspects of the UI directly when a user enters an app. During the making of this login screen I learned about Image sprites and how to change their size, rotate them, and change their color. I also learned how to basically put the sprite animations on a loop so they happen constantly in the background.


###[Animated Eagle App](https://github.com/JohnnyHartle7/AnimatedEagle)
Description: 
This is a simple app that has an eagle beginning in the center of the screen. A user is able to tap a location on the screen and the eagle will fly to that spot. 

Learning: 
While making this small game, I learned more about sprites and how to animate them. I learned that animations are basically just multiple different image sprites in an atlas and that you can “flip” through them to create an animation. I learned how to rotate a sprite and also how to make a sprite move to a location that was tapped by a user. In the future I want to combine what I learned making this app and the login screen to create animations that loop in the background of a given screen to add some spice to a login screen or just any screen.
